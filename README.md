## 📖 About the Project
A fully responsive and modern website developed for a real-world client. The main goal was to deliver a fast, user-friendly interface that meets the specific business requirements of the client.

## 🚀 How It Was Built (AI-Assisted Workflow)
This project was developed using a highly efficient, AI-first approach:
* **AI-Driven Generation:** The vast majority of the website, including the structure, layout, and core functionality, was rapidly generated using **bolt.new**.
* **Refinement & Polish:** The codebase was then imported into **Google Antigravity IDE**, where I utilized AI agents to apply specific tweaks, adjust styling, and fine-tune the final details to perfectly match the client's vision.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
* **Core Frontend:** React, Vite
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **AI Development Tools:** bolt.new, Google Antigravity IDE
* **Deployment & Hosting:** Cloudflare
